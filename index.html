        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Hi, I do game stuff and use Unreal Engine as my game engine.
            I mostly do gameplay programming but have decent grip on all aspects of game development lifecycle.
            I am passionate about games and love to designing and coding immersive gaming experiences.
            I know a thing or two about Uneral Engine, Blender and Maya.
        <p>I Play alot of games some of which are Valorant, COD MW2 , CSGO ,
            Genshin Impect and Krunker.</p>
        </p>
        <p>Here is some of the work i've done recently.</p>
        <ul>

                <summary>UE5 Multiplayer and Chat System</summary>
                <p class="detailsp">Unreal Engine Basic Project setup from Multiplayer using UE5's Replication system.
                    This was a perosonal project for learning Sockets implementation in Unreal
                    Engine 5 using VA-rest. Sockets are build Using Socket.io in Node.js.
                    Chat system is a standalone module of the project so it can be used with future projects with
                    minimul changes.
                    I had alot of fun doin it and in the mean time learned alot. I used WizardCell's Multiplayer blog to
                    study and build this project.</p>

                <summary>Pixel Streaming With UE5</summary>
                <p class="detailsp">This was a Freelance Project for a stealblue.llc for their architeture
                    visualization.
                    Pixel Streaming is solution of UE5 that enables us to use cloud hardware to run and render our high
                    fidelity applications and stream it to a web based frontend with the help of webRTC.

                    I used <a href="https://www.coreweave.com/solutions/pixel-streaming" target="_blank">Coreweave's
                        SPS</a>
                    Solution to deploy this product.
                    This tech is really usefull for architeture or product visualization and collaberative meetups. </p>

            <details>
                <summary>PixelStreaming With Multiplayer</summary>
                <p class="detailsp">This project includes all basic setup and implementations of a multiplayer game with
                    Pixel Streaming.
                    Multiplayer includes sessions, Profiling, Chat system, Access controll for admin through a web based
                    frontend (Made By a friend ~~).

                <summary>VR stuff</summary>
                <p class="detailsp">I've done alot or random bullshit for VR, Just playing around to do things with
                    Oculus Quest.
                    For starters i made an Office Scene in blender and added it to UE5 to use it on Vulkun but as you
                    might know lumen doesn't use bake lighting
                    and it looked absolute shit ðŸ˜¶
                    so inspired by Bruno Simon's <a href="https://my-room-in-3d.vercel.app/" target="_blank">My Room in
                        3D</a>
                    project work flow i baked the whole office in blender and the results were rather promising.
